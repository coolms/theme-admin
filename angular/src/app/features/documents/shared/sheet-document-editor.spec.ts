/**
 * Why the `.dsheet` editor registration in `app.config.ts` must be EXACT.
 *
 * A native spreadsheet template is opened by the Documents library
 * through `FileEditorRegistry`; with no entry for its mime the operator gets
 * "No editor is registered for this template format" on a template the backend
 * can otherwise mint, fill and render.
 *
 * ## What this spec does NOT cover, and why
 *
 * It cannot assert that `app.config.ts` performs the registration, because
 * importing that module for its side effects pulls the whole application graph
 * into the karma build — including `@coolms/designer`, whose `index.ts`
 * re-exports through ESM `./X.js` specifiers that the karma webpack build
 * cannot resolve (42 "Module not found" errors) even though `ng build` resolves
 * them fine. One such import takes the ENTIRE suite from 271 passing to zero
 * executed, so no spec may import `app.config`.
 *
 * What is testable is the property that makes the exact registration
 * load-bearing rather than tidy — pinned here so a future reader does not
 * "simplify" it into an `application/json` fallback that cannot fire.
